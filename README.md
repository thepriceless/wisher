# [Wisher](https://wisher.fun)
Wisher is a web-app for storing, sharing and updating your wishlists.

## Why [Wisher](https://wisher.fun) is useful?
Very often we have to make presents or receive them, however sometimes it can become a little weird or embarrassing process. You may make a bad choice for your friend, so the present will not satisfy him/her a lot. Or your guys just don't know what you want.

So, **Wisher** solves this problem providing some useful features for users:

- **storing wishitems** in several wishlists separated by privacy
- **creating new wishitems** from scratch
- scrolling the global wishitem line to **unleash the fantasy**
- find friends and see their wishlists

## Technology stack
- Backend: NodeJS, NestJS, TS, PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, Yandex Cloud Object Storage (S3)
- Frontend: Vanilla CSS + JS, Handlebars view templator
- Deployment: Docker, Ubuntu, Nginx
- CI/CD: triggered by Github Actions
