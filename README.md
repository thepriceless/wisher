> Wisher is a web-app for storing, sharing and updating your wishlists.

## <div align="center">Why [Wisher](https://wisher.fun) is useful?</div>
From time to time we have to make presents or receive them, however sometimes it can become a little weird or embarrassing process. You may make a bad choice for your friend, so the present will not satisfy him/her a lot. Or your guys just don't know what you want.

So, **Wisher** solves this problem providing some useful features for users:

- **storing wishitems** in several wishlists separated by privacy
- **creating new wishitems** from scratch
- scrolling the global wishitem line to **unleash the fantasy**
- **find friends** and see their wishlists
